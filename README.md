👋 Hi, I’m @Riya1818  

👩‍💻 I’m a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong interest in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI**, driven by both research and real-world problem solving.  

🧠 My experience includes a **Machine Learning Research Internship at BITS Pilani**, where I authored a **comprehensive survey on Dataset Distillation**, published with **IEEE (rating: 8.9/10)**. This work strengthened my foundation in ML theory, experimentation, and research-oriented thinking.  

🚀 I enjoy building impactful, data-driven systems end-to-end. Some of my key projects include:  
- **Vaayu** – An AI-powered personal air-quality advisor delivering AQI-based, health-aware recommendations using user profiling and real-time data.  
- **Medical AI Chatbot** – A conversational healthcare assistant leveraging **vector-based semantic embeddings** and LLM-based reasoning for accurate symptom-driven guidance.  
- **Connect** – A university-focused mental health and community platform designed to enable safe, meaningful peer interaction and support.  
- **Marketing Analytics Dashboard** – An interactive analytics dashboard providing **actionable business insights** through data visualization, KPI tracking, and trend analysis to support data-driven decision-making.  

📊 My core interests span **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, LLMs, Generative AI, Data Analytics, and AI-driven decision systems**, with a strong inclination toward translating research into scalable products.  

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on **ML/AI research, applied analytics projects, and open-source initiatives** where learning and real-world impact go hand in hand.
